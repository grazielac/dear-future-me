## Reflections
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
- I attempted to use EJS to reuse partials without copy-pasting code for my header & footer for each page but it got all messy so I copy-paste them manually instead. 
- 

What went really well?
- Good understanding of get and post request with the use of Postman, as well as implementing data on the database. 
- Setting up my server & client properly.

What could have gone better? 
-  Add content for each page
